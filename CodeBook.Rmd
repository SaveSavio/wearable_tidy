# CodeBook

Thisdocument describes the variables and data in my dataset as well as the cleanup work that I did.

## Source

The original source of this data is the University of California Irvine Machine Learning Repository at <http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones>

The data used for this project, however, was acquired from this link: <https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip>


## Description

The data is from a study where 30 subjects (labeled as 1:30) did a variety of six activities while wearing a Samsung Galaxy S smartphone on their waist.  The phone's gyroscope and accelerometer recorded measurements of linear acceleration and angular velocity at a sample rate of 50Hz.  The original data set contained 561 features of these measurements.  70% of the subjects' data was in a training data set and 30% was in a test data set.

The Activities were labeled with numbers 1:6 as follows

```{r , echo=FALSE}
myacts<-read.table("UCI HAR Dataset/activity_labels.txt")
myacts
```

## Transformation

The first data set provided is a result of the following cleanup actions:

1. Read in descriptive feature (variable) names from features.text and activity labels from activity_labels.txt
2. Read in the test data.
    a. Read in the test data set using the feature names as descriptive column names.
    b. Read in the test activity labels, convert them to activity names, and join them to the test data.
    c. Read in the test subject labels and join them to the test data.
3. Read in the train data.
    a. Read in the train data set using the feature names as descriptive column names.
    b. Read in the train activity labels, convert them to activity names, and join them to the train data.
    c. Read in the train subject labels and join them to the train data.
4. Combine test and train into one data set.















## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
